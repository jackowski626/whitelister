# whitelister
Whitelister is a Discord bot written in discord.py. It allows to whitelist Minecraft players from a Discord server. When a user reacts with an emote to a unique bot message, he receives a private message to which he has to reply with his username. If the username given by the user exists, the bot sends a message to a specific channel with three emotes. The user can react one of them to cancel the whitelist request. The two others permit moderators to approve or reject the request. The bot executes then an ftp request to fetch and update a server whitelist.json file. The code to verify Minecraft usernames and uuids is by Clemens Riese.
